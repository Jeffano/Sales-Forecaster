# SalesForecaster


This project involved creating a machine learning model to forecast sales and comparing the actual and forecasted sales using various metrics such as mean squared error, mean absolute error, and R2 score. The dataset used for training the model consisted of sales data for a specific item across different branches of a large retailer.

The goal of the project was to develop an application capable of analyzing datasets and predicting the sales of various items based on external factors. To achieve this, a team of five developers collaborated to construct a machine learning model using Jupyter Notebooks, TensorFlow, Scikit-learn, and XGBoost. The aim was to achieve accurate sales predictions with a margin of error of 5%.

The project involved implementing data preprocessing techniques on the dataset and constructing a data frame for making predictions. The technologies employed in this project included Python, Jupyter Notebooks, TensorFlow, Scikit-learn, NumPy, Pandas, XGBoost, and Matplotlib.
